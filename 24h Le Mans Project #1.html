                <h3 id="headline">History of Endurance Racing:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1923–1939</strong> - The 24 Hours of Le Mans was first run on 26 and 27 May 1923, through public roads around Le Mans.</li>
                    <li><strong>1949-1969</strong> - Following the reconstruction of circuit facilities, the race was resumed in 1949 with renewed interest from major automobile manufacturers.</li>
                    <li><strong>1970-1980</strong> - For the new decade, the race took a turn towards more extreme speeds and automotive designs. These extreme speeds led to the replacement of the typical standing Le Mans start with a rolling Indianapolis start.</li>
                    <li><strong>1981-1993</strong> - The circuit would also undergo one of its most notable changes in 1990, when the 5 km long Mulsanne was modified to include two chicanes in order to stop speeds of more than 400 km/h (250 mph) from being reached. This began a trend by the ACO to attempt to slow the cars on various portions of the track; although speeds over 320 km/h (200 mph) are still regularly reached at various points on a lap.</li>
                    <li><strong>1994-1999</strong> - Following the demise of the World Sportscar Championship, Le Mans saw a resurgence of production-based grand tourer cars.</li>
                    <li><strong>2000-2005</strong> - Many major automobile manufacturers withdrew from sports car racing after 1999 due to the high cost.</li>
                    <li><strong>2006-2013</strong> - This era saw other alternative fuel sources being used, including bio-ethanol.</li>
                    <li><strong>2014-2021</strong> - Regulations were changed for 2014, notably with a requirement that all LMP1 cars must be closed-cockpit, some changes to the hybrid system, and the introduction of the slow zone system. 2020 also saw the race held behind closed doors for the first time, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</li>
                    <li><strong>2021</strong> - A new Le Mans Hypercar class with regulations created jointly by the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO) and the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile replaces the Le Mans Prototype LMP1 class.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Le Mans takes the best out of everyone. Winning is important but it's not everything. It's such a big and great event in motorsport. You do more kilometres in that one race than Formula One do in a season, and probably a higher average speed. We average about 220km/h including pit stops and cover nearly 5000km.</p>
                <cite>Tom Kristensen - Danish former racing driver. He holds the record for the most wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans</cite>
